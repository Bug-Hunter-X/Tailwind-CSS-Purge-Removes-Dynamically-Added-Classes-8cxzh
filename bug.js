This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js.  The issue is that Tailwind's purge functionality, designed to remove unused styles, may aggressively remove classes that are dynamically added to elements. This can happen when you use JavaScript to conditionally add or remove classes, or in situations involving server-side rendering (SSR) where the classes aren't present in the initial HTML generated.
